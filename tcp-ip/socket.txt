In MATLAB, the socket functionality and Websockets are not the same. Hereâ€™s a brief comparison to clarify their differences:

Socket in MATLAB
Functionality: MATLAB's socket functions (tcpip, udp) provide basic networking capabilities for communication over TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
Usage:
TCP/IP (tcpip): Used for creating TCP/IP objects to establish connections and exchange data over TCP, which is reliable and ensures data integrity.
UDP (udp): Used for creating UDP objects to send and receive data over UDP, which is faster but does not guarantee data delivery.
Features: MATLAB's socket functions allow you to open connections, send data, and receive data. They are lower-level and require more manual handling compared to higher-level protocols like Websockets.
Limitations: MATLAB's socket functions in older versions (such as MATLAB 7.9.0) may lack advanced features found in modern Websocket libraries, such as bi-directional communication, event handling, and real-time updates.
Websockets
Functionality: Websockets are a higher-level protocol built on top of TCP/IP. They provide full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, allowing for bi-directional communication between clients and servers.
Usage: Websockets are commonly used in web applications for real-time data exchange, interactive applications, and streaming services where low latency communication is crucial.
Features: Websockets support features like message framing, binary data transfer, and event-driven architecture (e.g., onmessage events in JavaScript).
Applications: They are suitable for scenarios requiring frequent updates or real-time synchronization, such as chat applications, live feeds, and interactive dashboards.
Conclusion
While MATLAB 7.9.0 supports basic socket functionalities (tcpip, udp) for TCP/IP and UDP communication, it does not provide native support for Websockets. If you need to work with Websockets in MATLAB, especially for real-time applications or interactive data handling, you would typically need to use external libraries (possibly integrating with Java or Python) or consider upgrading to a newer version of MATLAB that includes more advanced networking capabilities.
