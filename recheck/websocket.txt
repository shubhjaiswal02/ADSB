To intercept and read the data received on the WebSocket in your MATLAB program, you can use the MatlabWebSocket library, which is a simple library consisting of a WebSocket server and client for MATLAB built on Java-WebSocket. Here's a step-by-step guide:
Step 1: Install the MatlabWebSocket Library
Download the MatlabWebSocket library from the GitHub repository: https://github.com/jebej/MatlabWebSocket
Follow the installation instructions provided in the repository.
Step 2: Create a WebSocket Client
Create a new MATLAB script or function.
Import the MatlabWebSocket library using the import statement.
Create a WebSocket client object using the MatlabWebSocket class.


Here's a sample code snippet:
matlab
% Import the MatlabWebSocket library
import MatlabWebSocket.*;

% Create a WebSocket client object
wsClient = MatlabWebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');

% Connect to the WebSocket server
wsClient.connect();

% Send a message to the WebSocket server
wsClient.send('Hello, WebSocket!');

Step 3: Receive Data from the WebSocket Server
Use the wsClient.onMessage method to receive data from the WebSocket server.
Implement a callback function to process the received data.


Here's a sample code snippet:
matlab
% Define a callback function to process the received data
function onDataReceived(wsClient, message)
    % Process the received data
    fprintf('Received data: %s\n', message);
end

% Set the callback function for the onMessage event
wsClient.onMessage = @onDataReceived;

Step 4: Close the WebSocket Connection
Use the wsClient.close method to close the WebSocket connection when you're done.
Here's a sample code snippet:
matlab
% Close the WebSocket connection
wsClient.close();
